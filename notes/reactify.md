## Redux

• [Redux contract & constraint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvAXVMwHJXU&app=desktop)

> Most of things we write in redux is not using its api directly, but follow its contract, write pure functions, pass around and process plain objects etc

For example, we can use reducer inside component without Redux:

```js
this.setState((prevState) => reduce(prevState, action));
```

### Redux `createStore`

```js
const createStore = (reducer) => {
  let state; // the whole state tree
  let listeners = [];

  const getState = () => state;
  const dispatch = (action) => {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    listeners.forEach((l) => l());
  };

  const subscribe = (listener) => {
    listeners.push(listener);
    // unsubscribe hook
    // const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(handler)
    // later: unsubscribe()
    return () => {
      listeners = listeners.filter((l) => l !== listener);
    };
  };
  // populate the initial state
  dispatch({});

  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe };
};
```

**[State shape design](https://hackernoon.com/avoiding-accidental-complexity-when-structuring-your-app-state-6e6d22ad5e2a)**

Redux encourages you to think about your application in terms of the data you need to manage. Plain object as top of state tree, further divide data into subtree, each level's key represents some 'domain', state can have 3 categories

- Domain data (e.g from db model)
- App / UI state, the selected item, isPending, modalShown etc.

[Scalable state maintaining](https://techblog.appnexus.com/five-tips-for-working-with-redux-in-large-applications-89452af4fdcb)

• Use map for list of data and selector to access data  
• Separate data state (from db) from view State  
•

### Reducer composition

For every action, all sub reducers will be called passed in partial state each reducer handles and only react to action it is interested in (so every reducer has 'default' for non-interest action, just return the original state). The result will be merged back

```js
/***
state shape: {
  todos: [...],
  filter: 'string'
}
***/
const rootReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  // nextState always a new object
  return {
    todos: todosReducer(state.todos, action),
    filter: filterReducer(state.filter, action),
  };
};
```

It's so common in practice, redux has `combineReducers` for this, an util to return `rootReducer` function. Can be used in all level of state, i.e nested combineReducers

```js
const combineReducers = (reducers) => {
  // this is passed to createStore, accept the whole current state tree
  return (state= {}, action) => {
    return Object.keys(reducers)
      .reduce((nextState, key) => {
         // call each reducer to produce the whole updated state tree
         nextState[key] = reducers[key](state[key], action)
         return nextState;
      }, {}) // a new initial nextState
  }
}
// use it to create createStore
createStore(combineReducers({
  todos: todosReducer // or todos if we export function name same as the state key
  filter
}))

combineReducers({
  todos: combineReducers({
    myTodo: (todos.myTodo, action) => next myTodo
    yourTodo: (todos.myTodo, action) => next yourTodo
  }),
  filter: otherReducer
})
```

### `connect` HOC to store

Container subscribes to store by providing handler fn, get state they need from store, setState on component. we use connect from `react-redux`. It is high order component wrapping around original container, and implement a performant `shouldComponentUpdate()` optimization which skips rendering if the part of the state selected by `mapStateToProps()` has not changed. When something changed, container receive nextState as props from high order component generated by `connect`. Instead of subscribing to store and `setState` explicitly inside container

```js
this.setState({
  data1: store.getState().data1,
});
// we do connect, no need to talk to store directly
connect(
  /**
   * mapStateToProps = (state, {params}) => ({
   *   todos: selector(state.todos, )
   * })
   **/
  mapStateToProps,
  /**
   * with following, we can this.props.onTodoClick which dispatch action created by `toggleTodo`
   * it's shorthand of mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
   *   onTodoClick(id) {dispatch(toggleTodo(id))}
   * })
   **/
  { onTodoClick: toggleTodo, receiveTodos }
)(Component);
```

It's design concern to Find who need to act as container component which handles behaviour (e.g what happens when clicking), and delegate actual look to a set of presentational components, those handlers will passed down to presentation from container, where handlers are actually triggered

## Advanced topics

Some useful links for [order of state updates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48563650/does-react-keep-the-order-for-state-updates/48610973#48610973) discussion and [async setState](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11527#issuecomment-360199710)

- The state is updated in the same order as setState called. The most recent value of the same state key 'wins'

- The state update is batched  
  When called in event handler (click button), only single re-render at the end of event (but not batched when setting async data )

- The state is shallowly merged

```js
setState(pendingState: object || func, callback)
// when next state is based on previous state value
setState((prevState, props) => ({counter: prevState.counter + props.step}))
```

### HOC with Forwarded Ref

Introduced in 16.3, `Forwarded Ref` allow expose child DOM (or component instance) ref to parent component, by `forwarding` this ref variable via `React.createRef()` to the child component we want.  
How is this related to HOC pattern? Let's review what HOC is first. The definition is that HOC takes a component, return a new component. We use this newly decorated component outside, it has same look and feel as the original component inside.

Why need this? Main reason is to reuse logic (not UI like other functional components). Separate the logic from the presentation. See example below:

```js
function switcher(WrappedComponent) {
  class Switcher extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        toggled: false,
      };
    }
    toggle() {
      this.setState((prevState, props) => ({ toggled: !prevState.toggled }));
    }
    render() {
      // the wrapped can trigger onToggle and re-render
      // based on toggled state passed into
      <WrappedComponent
        {...this.props}
        toggled={this.state.toggled}
        onToggle={this.toggle}
      />;
    }
  }
  return Switcher;
}

switcher(<PlayButton />);
switcher(<LoopButton />);
```

All things can be made switchable. They don't have to be button at all! Anything clickable and have flipped state to show ui accordingly, can be enhanced.

Redux `connect` is similar pattern, make `store.subscribe`, receive new state and `shouldComponentUpdate` reusable, can be opted into any container component that need to be aware of state change.

Let's look at the `forwardRef` now.

```js
// ref can only be passed with forwardRef in additional to normal props
const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
  <button ref={ref} className='FancyButton'>
    {props.children}
  </button>
));
// since FancyButton is forwarding ref, the ref will not point to its own instance
// FancyButton now have access to underlying button instance via ref.current
const ref = React.createRef();
<FancyButton ref={ref}>Click</FancyButton>;
```

Here is another use case for HOC, implemented as `render` callback, allow extra prop `ref` to be passed to child down the tree. Without it, the ref will not be passed.
`withRouter` has similar way to pass extra route related props (location etc)

### Effect Hooks

`useEffect` is used to 'schedule' some callbacks to perform side effect, like API calls, set up subscription / timeout / event handler and manual DOM manipulation. We can think of applying effect as synchronisation between each React rendering. After each rendering or dependencies the effect relies on change, the effect function is able to synced with latest state and props. It might server similar purpose to `didMount`, `didUpdate` lifecycles, but very different in terms of underlying execution.

- The time it gets triggered  
  React remembers each effect function for each render, execute them in order after committing changes to DOM and browser painting the screen. So it does not block browser from updating the screen.

  > Although useEffect is deferred until after the browser has painted, it’s guaranteed to fire before any new (next) renders. React will always flush a previous render’s effects before starting a new update.

- Part of rendering result  
  Each rendering creates a new effect function that captures `props` and `state` belong to that particular render (through JS closure) if it does not specify any in the dependency array. If empty array, effect always referencing the props and state variables from first render.

- Clean up  
  Same rule as running effect, the 'clean up' function from previous effect is triggered after React current rendering and Browser painting, and then apply new effect belongs to the current rendering.

  ```js
  function FriendStatus(props) {
    useEffect(() => {
      // ...
      ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
      return () => {
        ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
          props.friend.id,
          handleStatusChange
        );
      };
    }, [props.friend.id]);
  }
  ```

  When friend id changed from 10 -> 20,

  - React renders UI with new props {id: 20}
  - React commits updates and Browser paints
  - Clean up effect: unsubscribe(10)
  - Effect applied subscribe(20)

  //

- Avoid effect re-run  
  All props, state variables and inner functions in the component used by effect becomes effect's dependencies. It requires us to think clearly what triggers the effect running, specify them clearly in the dependancy array.

  If we want to only run effect and clean up once, blindly specify empty array to trick React could end up with some bugs.

  ```js
  function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
      // interval callback always runs setCount(0 + 1)
      // as it captures initial state count = 0
      const id = setInterval(() => setCount(count + 1), 1000);
      return () => clearInterval(id);
    }, []);

    return <span>{count}</span>;
  }
  ```

  One way to do is to useReducer to separate how state gets updated from effect. So effect does not rely on any state, it only triggers the intention to update through `dispatch`.

  ```js
  function Counter(props) {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0, step: 1 });
    const reducer = (state, action) => {
      const { count, step } = state;
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'tick':
          return { count: count + step, step };
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };

    useEffect(() => {
      const id = setInterval(() => dispatch({ type: 'tick' }), 1000);
      return () => clearInterval(id);
      // can omit dispatch, as it is not created between render,
      // useReducer always returns the same dispatch function
    }, [dispatch]);
  }
  ```

### Performance

`shouldComponentUpdate`: "Should component related UI need to be updated?"  
If yes, we certainly need to perform reconciliation process: re-rendering on that component to generate new elements tree, diff it with previous and figure out DOM updates.  
If no, we can skip the process from that component and its entire subtree.

• Functional (stateless) component  
Implemented as pure function (not Pure component), the output is only based on input props

• PureComponent  
Class component, stateless or stateful, could perform side effect, but only re-render when props or state changed
